My name is Spike and I am available for adoption.<p></p><p></p>I was brought in by my previous owner on October 5, 2017 because they could not keep me anymore. I lived in a home with another large dog.<p></p><p></p>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p></p><p></p>I would like a home with experienced handlers that can help me to get all of my big boy energy out! I am a runner and I love to play with toys. But, most of all, I LOVE TREATS and FOOD and TREATS and FOOD!<p></p><p></p>I don't know very many commands, just &quot;sit&quot;, but I'm eager to learn more. My caregivers think it will be easy to teach me, because I will do anything for food. Seriously, I love food!<p></p><p></p>I haven't met kids before, and my caregivers at the shelter think that I may like them, but we would have to meet first to see if we vibe.  However, I love food so much that sometimes, I tend to get cranky if someone takes away my food, so little kids that can't follow my rules may not be suitable for me. <p></p><p></p>I am just a giant lovebug and would love someone who loves food just as much as me to take me home!<p></p><p></p> Adoption Fee: $200.00<p></p>"

My name is Loki and I am available for adoption.<p></p><p></p>I was brought in by my previous owner on April 30, 2017 because they were moving. I lived in a home with a family that had kids but due to my history of using my mouth when I am uncomfortable, my caregivers are recommending that I go to an adult only home.<p></p><p></p>I prefer the &quot;hands-off&quot; approach, meaning that I will jump on your lap and interact, but it's all on my terms. I tend to get feisty if I get too much attention....typical catitude! I am very food motivated and love snacks and toys.  If you want a cool cat, come adopt me!<p></p><p></p>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited cat with a fun-loving personality! I may be sensitive to handling, so I would do best in a home with a cat savvy family who knows when to give me some space.<p></p><p></p>A veterinarian has diagnosed or tentatively diagnosed the above-described pet with the following condition(s):<p></p><p></p>1)     This cat has a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).  He is currently being treated with oral steroids.  This condition will require long term management, which could include medications and prescription diets.  We recommend you follow up with your regular veterinarian for the best treatment plan.  An information handout is also provided.<p></p><p></p>2)   This cat has a history of struvite crystals in the urine and urinary tract infections.  He is currently being managed with a prescription diet (Hill's C/D).  This condition will most likely need longterm manament and treatment.<p></p><p></p>As a result of these conditions, your pet may need specialized care consisting of any or all of the below.  Please note this is not intended to be an exhaustive list.<p></p><p></p>- Special diet or prescription foods<p></p>- Prescription or over-the-counter medicines<p></p>- Special skin care or shampoos<p></p>- Regular veterinarian visits, which may include blood tests or other monitoring<p></p>- Possible surgery or other procedures as determined by your veterinarian<p></p><p></p> Adoption Fee: $30.00<p></p>"

My name is Roxy and I am available for adoption.<p></p><p></p>I was brought in by my previous owner on August 19, 2017 because sometimes I went to the bathroom outside the litter box. <p></p><p></p>My personality color is BLUE. I am a gentle and loving cat who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p></p><p></p>I am an affectionate lovebug who would be thrilled to cuddle up with you at home!<p></p><p></p>I was previously declawed on  all four paws. Because I can't protect myself outside, I need to be an indoor-only cat.<p></p><p></p>A veterinarian has diagnosed or tentatively diagnosed the above-described pet with the following condition(s):<p></p><p></p>1)     House soiling:  This cat has a long history of house soiling (primarily urinating).  The previous owner attempted to have this problem evaluated at a veterinarian and while the problem would resolve for periods of time, it happened repeatedly.  Based on the history, this problem is likely a behavioral problem but we recommend discussing this with your veterinarian to determine if further medical evaluation<p></p><p></p>2)  Heart murmur:  During our routine exam, a heart murmur was found.  There are currently no signs of heart disease.  In order to determine the cause of the heart murmur, a cardiac study called an echocardiogram would need to be performed.  Although many animals live normal lives with heart murmurs, it is important to discuss this with your veterinarian.<p></p><p></p>As a result of these conditions, your pet may need specialized care consisting of any or all of the below.  Please note this is not intended to be an exhaustive list.<p></p><p></p>- Special diet or prescription foods<p></p>- Prescription or over-the-counter medicines<p></p>- Regular veterinarian visits, which may include blood tests or other monitoring<p></p>- Possible surgery or other procedures as determined by your veterinarian<p></p><p></p>My caregivers have noticed that I do not seem to get along with other cats, so I may do best as the only cat in my new home. This could be why I did not always use my litterbox.<p></p><p></p><p></p> Adoption Fee: $30.00<p></p>"

I was brought in by my previous owner on October 13, 2017 with my friend Nox #A234716 because I was having litterbox issues after my owner began travelling more and there was construction going on in the house.  I lived in a home with another cat.  My previous owner described me as loving and friendly.  Once I warm up, I am an affectionate lovebug who would be thrilled to cuddle up with you at home!  My caregivers have noticed that I seem to do well with other cats.  When meeting cats in a new home, I would do best with a slow introduction.  My personality color is GREEN.  I am an adaptable cat who loves to go with the flow!  I am outgoing and carefree, and I just can't wait to find my forever home!  I do have some medical issues that may require specialized care.  Abnormally dilute urine that may indicate early kidney issues.  I also have a low grade heard murmur, as well as some moderate dental issues.  The officers and veterinarians at the shelter will be happy to answer any questions you may have when you come visit me.  I can't wait to meet you!<p></p> Adoption Fee: $30.00<p></p>"
